### Backend
-   **API**: To receive random profiles, I used [randomuser](https://randomuser.me/)

### Packages used

-   **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the browser.
-   **Express**: As the production web server.
-   **Jest**: Used it for testing.
-   **Sass**: I prefer to use sass for its nested rules feature.
-   **Vue**: Main frontend framework.
-   **Vuex**: For state management.

### What would I improve?

- Add more tests
- Comments & JSdoc annotations inside the files
- Change the hover on cards to work with clicks on mobile view. Currently it is only optimal for web view.
- Involve a UX designer - the challenge in this project was that in a typical working environment, it is easier to ask designers about how things should look like. However, in  this project, I had to make these decisions myself.

Overall, I had fun working on this app, and I am looking forward to your feedback!
